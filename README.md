Turtle Race Game – Python
📌 About the Project

This is a Python-based Turtle Race Game created using the turtle graphics module. The game allows the user to bet on a turtle by choosing a color. All turtles move forward randomly, and the turtle that reaches the finish line first wins the race.

🎮 How It Works

Six turtles with different colors are placed at the starting position.

The user enters a color to place a bet.

The race starts automatically.

Each turtle moves forward by a random distance.

The winning turtle is announced, and the user is told whether they won or lost.
